                Tree planting can be hard in certain areas and some bought one and don’t know how to plant it. This will teach you how.
            </span>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Dig a shallow and broad hole. The hole should be about 2-3 times wider than the root ball   
                </li>
                <li>
                    If wrapped, remove any cover from around the root ball and trunk to facilitate root growth. Remove the wire basket or cut one or two rings off so it is low-profile and will not interfere with future root growth. Inspect tree root ball for circling roots and straighten, cut, or remove them. Expose the trunk flare if necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the tree at the proper height. When placing the tree in the hole, lift by the root ball, not the trunk. The majority of tree’s roots develop in the top 12 inches (30 cm) of soil. Planting too deep can be harmful to the tree
                </li>
                <li>
                    Straighten the tree in the hole. Before filling the hole, have someone examine the tree from several angles to confirm it is straight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fill the hole gently but firmly. Pack soil around the base of the root ball to stabilize it. Fill the hole firmly to eliminate air pockets. Further reduce air pockets by watering periodically while backfilling. Avoid fertilizing at the time of planting. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If staking is necessary, three stakes or underground systems provide optimum support. Studies have shown that trees develop stronger trunks and roots if they are not staked; however, it may be required when planting bare root stock or on windy sites. Remove stakes after the first year of growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mulch the base of the tree. Place a 2–3 inch (5–7.5 cm) layer of mulch, but be sure not to pile much right against the trunk. A mulch-free area of 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) wide at the base of the tree will reduce moist bark and prevent decay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide follow-up care. Keep the soil moist by watering at least once a week, barring rain, and more frequently during hot, windy weather. Continue until mid-fall, tapering off as lower temperatures require less-frequent watering.
                </li>
            </ol>

                Mulching 
            </h1>
            <p>
                Mulch is used functionally and as a decoration. Mulch is used to protect the roots of a plant from droughts, weeds, heat, and cold.it also provides nutrients to the plants as it decomposes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                First, determine the square footage of the area you want to mulch by measuring it. Multiply the length and width of the area to cover and record the answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determine how deep mulch should be by going with gardening experts' recommendation of a 2- to 4-inch layer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiply the square footage of your area to be mulched by the number of inches of mulch you want to apply. Then divide that number by 12, as a cubic foot of mulch will cover 12-square feet with about 1-inch of mulch.  
            </p>
            <h3>
                Afterwords
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, edge the area you want to mulch to keep mulch from spilling onto grass. You may also build a barrier with stones or bricks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove old mulch by shoveling it into a wheelbarrow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dispose of that or add to a compost pile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smooth and level the area to be mulched with a landscaping rake or by hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apply a layer of plastic mulch or fabric landscape sheeting for extra weed control.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unbag the new mulch into a wheelbarrow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using a shovel or hands, place small mounds of mulch around the space you are working with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid dumping big piles of mulch into your space, as that could result in too much mulch where you don’t want it. It can also damage or suffocate smaller plantings and tree or shrub roots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using a rake or gloved hands, smooth out the small mounds of mulch to the desired depth of 2- to 4-inches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leave at least one inch between mulch and any tree trunks or plants so root systems have necessary space to circulate air and water, being careful not to suffocate existing plant growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Water the area only lightly for the first 24- to 48-hours of applying new mulch.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Maintaining your mulch 
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Colored or dyed mulch can stain walkways and concrete if water seeps out from it during rain or overwatering. Spread mulch during a dry spell of at least 24- to 48-hours to allow it to fully dry out so the colors won’t “bleed.” While safe, the dye can come off with contact or water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid dousing your newly-mulched area with too much water for at least 24-hours. A light sprinkling for the plants is okay. The goal is to keep water contained within a newly mulched area to prevent seepage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Should stains occur to concrete or stonework areas, scrubbing them away with a brush and a water hose should resolve them. If the stain is stubborn, use a pressure washer. It’s best to remove any mulch stains you notice immediately, before they set into stonework or concrete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If weeds sprout through the mulch, remove them by hand when first visible to keep them under control, or use a weed and grass killer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep in mind that weather elements like sunshine, rain and wind will fade and deteriorate organic and inorganic mulch. A fresh-from-the-bag appearance when you apply mulch is temporary and dependent on your unique weather conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turning mulch gently with a lightweight rake or by hand can also quickly freshen any faded appearance.
                </li>
