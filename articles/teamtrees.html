        <h3>
            What is Team Trees?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Team Trees is a fundraiser that is run by Mr. Beast that started running in 2019 in order to raise 20 million dollars to plant 20 million trees. He has accomplished this goal since then and has planted all of the trees. People still donate and he still plants more trees. It started from someone on reddit suggesting the idea to Mr. Beast because he reached 20 million subscribers. Mr. Beast and Mark Rober both worked on the planting of the trees and planted in several countries.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Did it Scam Anyone? 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The short answer is no they did not scam anyone, everyone who paid before December of 2022 got their tree planted. Some people after 2022 would still pay and he still plants their trees. No one was scammed in the process of paying for Team Trees because they knew that when they paid they would get what they get.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Is it Worth Donating to Team Trees still?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Of course it is, if you donate to Team Trees you get trees planted, and the world needs more trees. Donating to Team Trees is a great way for someone to plant trees if they can’t plant a tree themselves, plus it only costs a dollar. It is by far the best and easiest way to help the environment without doing work for yourself.
