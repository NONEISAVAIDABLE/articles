                What is Ecosia?
            </h1>
            <span>
                Ecosia is a search engine based in Berlin, Germany. Ecosia considers itself a social business, claiming to be CO₂-negative, supporting full financial transparency, and protecting the privacy of its users. Ecosia is B Lab certified, meeting its standards of accountability, sustainability, and performance.
            </span><br/><br/>
            <span>
                Co2-negative: this title used to describe a business that takes away more carbon dioxide than what they make every year.

                How do they plant trees?
            </h3>
            <span>
                They get the money to plant the trees through the ad revenue they get. So far they have planted about over 150 million trees!

                Ecosia is a certified B-corp 
            </h3>
            <span>
                A B-corp is defined as a for-profit corporation that has been certified by B Lab, which is a non-profit company that measures a company's social and environmental performance against the standards in the online B Impact Assessment. There are over 4,000 Certified B Corps in 77 countries across 153 different industries.

                Do they steal your search history?
            </h3>
            <span>
                They don't even save any personal data, so they aren't able to steal data if they wanted to. There are other sources that claim that they are browser-hijackers, but their evidence for this can also be evidence to go against other search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
