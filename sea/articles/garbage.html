<h1> The Great Pacific Garbage Patch </h1>

<h3>What it is</h3><p>The Great Pacific garbage patch (also Pacific trash vortex and North Pacific garbage patch) is a garbage patch, a gyre of marine debris particles, in the central North Pacific Ocean. It is located between Hawaii and California. The collection of plastic and floating trash originates from the Pacific Rim, including countries in Asia, North America, and South America.the patch covers 620,000 square miles consisting of 50,000–142,000 tons of plastic as of 2018.</p><h3>How it Came to be</h3><p>In a revealing 2015 study published in the esteemed journal Science, researchers took a deep dive into the origins of oceanic garbage, with a particular focus on the ubiquitous problem of plastic debris. Their meticulous analysis unearthed a concerning trend: the majority of discarded plastics and other waste meander eastward from six key sources nestled in the heart of Asia. From the bustling cities of China to the pristine shores of Sri Lanka, countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand contribute significantly to this environmental conundrum.<br/><br/>Adding weight to these findings, sources like National Geographic have sounded the alarm, reporting that a staggering 80 percent of plastic pollution in our oceans stems from land-based sources. However, it's not just solid ground that's to blame; marine activities like fishing and maritime transportation also have a hand in this environmental crisis, accounting for the remaining 20 percent. The complexity of the issue becomes evident when considering regional nuances, as highlighted in a 2018 study which found synthetic fishing nets to be a dominant force in the infamous Great Pacific garbage patch. Such revelations underscore the urgent need for global collaboration and concerted action to tackle this pressing environmental challenge head-on.</p>
