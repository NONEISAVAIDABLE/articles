        </h3>
        <p>
            There are many health benefits that come with being vegan. These benefits include lower risk of cancer development, weight loss, improved digestion, increased fiber intake, diabetes (type 2), heart disease, etc. Veganism is beneficial to the environment because the use of animal products has a large negative effect on the environment. For example, the amount of grain feed used for meat contributes to the act of deforestation.
