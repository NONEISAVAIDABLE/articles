            Although this is up to opinion. Eating healthy is a great lifestyle choice that many people have chosen. There are many different healthy foods, tips, and benefits that I will be telling you about.
        </span>
        <h3>
            Tips to healthy eating 
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Basing your diet on fiber, starchy carbohydrates. These include potatoes, cereal, rice, pasta, and bread
            </li>
            <li>
                Eating a lot of vegetables and fruits can also promote healthy eating. You should eat at least 5 portions of canned, dried, frozen, juiced, or fresh vegetables and fruit everyday
            </li>
            <li>
                Stop eating foods with saturated fats and sugar as saturated fats increase cholesterol which in turn increases the risk of heart disease. Sugar on the other hand can cause obesity and also causes tooth decay.
            </li>
            <li>
                Eating a lot of salt is not advised as this can increase blood pressure which increases risk of heart disease and stroke. This is a tricky one as even if you don’t add salt to your food there may still be salt in it.
            </li>
            <h3>

            </h3>
            <span>
                There are many foods and liquids that promote health. Water is one liquid that everyone should drink about 11.5 cups daily as it is recommended by the U.S National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. Dark greens are also a great food that promotes health. Some foods of this category include broccoli, brussel sprouts, peppers, and leafy greens like kale and spinach. Eating whole grains is recommended for a person to eat inorder to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Whole grain foods include oatmeal, crackers, whole grain bread, and brown rice. Beans can also be included on your list as they are a great source of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Some legumes include chickpeas, lentils, peanuts, and peas.
